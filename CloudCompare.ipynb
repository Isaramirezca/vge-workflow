    "\n",
    "Cloud Compare is an open-source 3D point cloud processing software that allows users to import, export, and manipulate large 3D point clouds, meshes, and images. Cloud Compare can be used for a variety of applications, such as geospatial analysis, topography, archaeology, and cultural heritage. Cloud Compare can handle different types of 3D data, including LiDAR data, photogrammetry, and laser scanning data and has an intuitive user interface and advanced features allowing the use from non specialists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool allow us to manipulate the point cloud obtained from ODM by cleaning, cutting, classifying the points, among other uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the latest stable version from the CloudCompare [website](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/release/) and install it like any other software. Once installed here are some useful tutorials and tips. \n",

    "### Point Cloud Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "One very useful feature is to be able to section and manually classify the point cloud. For this you will need to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the Point Cloud: Open CloudCompare and load the point cloud you want to classify by going to File > Open or by using the toolbar shortcut.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be asked about the fields you want to import, you can simply click the `Apply all` button. \n",
    "After that CloudCompare will need a global shift so the coordinates of each point are smaller numbers, allowing for better performance. CloudCompare stores the shift and scale values as meta-data and (tries to) keep them all along the entity life. Eventually, when the user saves the entity CloudCompare will restore the original coordinate system (if the output file format allows for 64 bits values storage), [Source.](https://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php/Global_Shift_and_Scale#But_why.3F)\n",

    "</figure>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some important tips are, to be able to manipulate a specific point cloud you have to first select it, although you might visualize several point clouds (if you loaded several) you will only applying changes to the currently selected point cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: Point Clouds are very memory comsuming so there's no 'undo' function in Cloud Compare. You should save the cloud on disk from time to time (in BIN format by default) and use it as backup. And take into account that when you save, you will only be saving the cloud. It is also adviseable to create clones of your current processed point cloud and work on them before and delete the original once you are happy with the result (since you can't undo).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select the segmentation button in the toolbar (the icon with a scissors). This mode allows you to manually create segments which can be later merged and assign labels to points or groups of points. A visual step-by-step is available [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKGUBdTKpy4&t=21s)\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Assign a class to a selected group of points by using the `#` button. The classified sections should look like in the images below.\n",
