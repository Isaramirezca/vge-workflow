    "# Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 1997 and 2002 terms like “virtual geography” and Virtual Geographic Environment (VGE) started to appear. Subsequently, the term was continuously explored in international conferences and papers, and later from 2009 on the concept “exploded” clearly differentiating itself from GIS and digital twins (Lin et al., 2022). The term “virtual” refers to something that exists in a computer-generated or simulated environment, rather than in the physical world. In this sense, VGE refers broadly and collectively to all geographic environments which are not “real”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VGE is defined by Hui Lin as a new generation of web- and computer based geographic analysis tool built on the foundations of GIS and GIScience. VGEs allow users to be more deeply embedded in a specifically geographical environment, providing experiences and insights that were not possible with traditional GISystems thus contributing to our understanding of the geographic world and helping solve geographic problems at a deeper level (Lin et al., 2013; Lin and Batty, 2009). VGEs can vary from systems primarily focused on spatial analytics for professional and scientific purposes, to systems designed to make geographic information more accessible and widely avail\u0002able to the general public (Lin and Batty, 2009)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of VGEs\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary features of a VGE are spatial three-dimensional reconstruction, multidimensional visualization, process modeling and simulation, knowledge sharing and collaboration and interaction with the physical environment. In more detail, VGEs are three-dimensional accurate spatial-temporal referenced reconstructions of geographic environments. These reconstructions can be done with traditional photogrammetry, laser scanning or Structure from Motion (SfM). These reconstructions are transformed into 3D spatial visualizations. However, VGEs offer more than just that, as they provide the potential for including other dimensions like time, and immersion like virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality. VGEs are also known modeling and simulation of processes in order to better understand sociofor offering geographic environments and support decision making. Furthermore, and more precisely distinguishing VGEs from GIS are the interactive, collaborative and knowledge sharing nature of VGEs thus not professionals from specific fields but opening the doors for multidisciplinarylimiting the use to and participation from the general public and allowing for participation and collaboration from different regions (Lin et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three-dimensional reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a VGE, it is necessary to have a reliable method of gathering information from the actual geographic surroundings, along with a proficient system for distributing, networking, visualizing and communicating that information (Lü, 2011; Lin et al., 2013).\n",
    "One of the most used products for representing geographic environments like terrain elevation are “rasters” or Digital Elevation Models (DEM). A raster is a data structure that represents spatially continuous phenomena, such as elevation, as a grid of cells or pixels. Each cell or pixel in the grid has a value which is often built using interpolation techniques, estimating the cell values based on contained and surrounding data points. Despite the fact that rasters are widely used, most of the time they come from point clouds, and these point clouds are already 3D reconstructions of a geographic environment. High-resolution topographic data is often available as point clouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Point clouds are obtained by physically surveying the elevation of the terrain using equipment such as total stations, GNSS receivers, or laser scanning among other technologies or can also be obtained with remote sensing techniques using satellite imagery, LiDAR, radar technology or with the use of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which have revolutionized the collection and processing of geospatial data. UAV refers to an aircraft that is flown remotely without a pilot on board. UAVs are often controlled by a human operator on the ground using a remote control or a computer program. They can also be pre-programmed to fly autonomously on a specific route or to carry out a particular mission. The term UAV can refer to balloons, airships, gliders, single-, double-, four- and multi-rotor systems among others, that come in many different sizes and price ranges. Some of the most popular UAVs used for elevation reconstruction are UAV LiDAR and UAV photogrammetry. UAV photogrammetry refers in this text to the use of Structure from Motion with small and lightweight drones equipped with a camera and a GNSS (commonly known as GPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Photogrammetry is the process of collecting, measuring, and analyzing images in order to get geometric information about physical objects. Photogrammetry captures high-resolution photographs to recreate a survey area, with distinct features overlapping in numerous images. The location of each feature is then measured using triangulation (determining a 3D object’s coordinates by using photographs to cover the same object but from different positions). In contrast to classical photogrammetry Structure from Motion (SfM) or UAV photogrammetry, it is a computer vision technique that is easier to use where image processing and camera calibration can be performed automatically, and depending on the application, there is often no need for ground control points (Marteau et al., 2017). On the other hand, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) operates on the same principles as radar where a pulse of light is emitted from an instrument, travels through space, hits a target, and when returning is detected by a sensor. While the accuracy of UAV photogrammetry is lower compared to UAV LiDAR, for reconstructing landforms SfM provides high quality mapping products similar to those obtained with LiDAR at significantly lower cost (Carrivick, Smith, and Quincey, 2016; Ruzgiene et al.,2015). -->\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its comparable low cost, mobility, and simplicity, the rapidly evolving landscape of UAV has led to a proliferation of research and development efforts in a wide range of uses, including mapping, 3D models reconstruction, remote sensing, and archaeological site monitoring (Mohammadi et al. 2021; Jiménez-Jiménez et al., 2021; Ferrer-González et al., 2020).\n",
    "UAV photogrammetry for river development and monitoring is not lagging behind, and there can be found applications like monitoring bank erosion along river corridors (Hamshaw et al., 2019), search and mapping of river boundaries (Rathinam et al., 2007), measurement of water surface flow velocity distributions in rivers (Chen et al., 2021), monitoring of river restoration (Evans et al., 2022; Langhammer, 2019), assessment of eco-morphological riverine environments (Díaz-Delgado, Cazacu, and Adamescu, 2018; Gallo et al., 2019; Rusnák et al., 2022), construction of river bathymetry (Legleiter and Harrison, 2019), monitoring of flood-induced morphological changes (Akay, Özcan, and ¸Sanlı, 2022) among many other applications (Rhee et al., 2018; Carrivick and Smith, 2019; Marteau et al., 2017; Guimarães et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional Visualization The goal of VGEs is to provide digital windows of real-world geographic environments, allowing users to experience them closer to being there in person. This is achieved by using technology to enhance their senses and by simulating geographic phenomena. Thus, 3D spatial visualization is one of the main characteristics of VGEs, this can be because it has been already very well documented that 3D visualization enhances learning in different contexts. For example, it has been found that 3D animations can increase students’ interest and make the material more appealing to them and that interactive 3D virtual environments have a greater contribution to the learning process than other types of visualization (in the case of 8th and 12th grade students) (Korakakis et al., 2009; Korakakis et al., 2012). Multimodal 3D visualizations can reduce memory load and facilitate memory recall (Do, Moreland, and Korchek, 2010). The potential of 3D visualization technology in enhancing learning and teaching in higher education has also been demonstrated in various fields like Art and Design (atera2009potential; Park, Kim, and Sohn, 2011), urban conservation (Koramaz and Gulersoy, 2011), geology (Boese, Sheng, Salam, et al., 2009) and medicine (Said et al., 2015; Silén et al., 2008). And it’s demonstrated that VR can enhance elicitation techniques (Bhimani and Spoletini, 2017; Harman, Brown, and Johnson, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the specific case of geographic information 2D visualizations can be limited and abstract, making the understanding process hard for non-experts. Multidimensional visualization, on the other hand, makes it easier to present dynamic geographic phenomena (Lin et al., 2013; Mat et al., 2014). It’s been long recognized that new analysis tools are needed to provide a more realistic experience and enhance people’s understanding and communication of geographic information (Goodchild, 2005). In response to that, 3D visualization has been used to aid environmental restoration of urbanizations and to support design and planning processes (Martínez-Graña and Valdés Rodríguez, 2016; Yin and Shiode, 2014) and 3D visualization of physical geographic phenomena though game engines have also been explored although real geographic scenario and laws are often lacking in these virtual environments (Mat et al., 2014) 3D spatial analysis functions can enable more powerful features, such as\n",
    "sunlight analysis, the network analysis of underground objects, and 3D pathfinding analysis and navigation (Lin et al., 2013). In the case of urban models, it has been demonstrated that spatial attributes and characteristics are better defined in 3D than in 2D mapping techniques (Koramaz and Gulersoy, 2011). The benefits of 3D geovisualization for citizen participation process have also been highlighted (Marzouki et al., 2017) and 3D visualization has been already proposed for public outreach in the context of fluvial geomorphology (Brandt and Jiang, 2004). Immersive 3D geovisualization (3D CAVE) can effectively be used in higher education and enhance interactive learning between students (Philips et al., 2015), and 3D geovisualization has long been proposed in Planning Education (Yin, 2010). \n",

    "## Modeling and Simulation\n",
    "Modeling and simulation in VGEs go beyond basic spatial analysis (like interpolation techniques), which has traditionally been the primary application of previous GIS. Instead, they aim to develop models that enable computation of dynamic geographic processes, such as water flow simulation, geomorphological changes, and more (Lin et al., 2013). An advanced VGE can enable specialists to utilize both quantitative and qualitative analysis, simulation strategies, and coordination techniques to create models of potential scenarios, simulate and analyze geographical phenomena, and collectively depict and anticipate changes in the geographical setting. Moreover, non-expert users can visualize the temporal and spatial correlations between environmental and societal factors within a virtual realm, thereby amplifying participation (Lü, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction, collaboration and participation\n",
    "When talking about education and public outreach, interaction, collaboration and participation is one of the most important features of a VGE and is also the feature that most differentiates VGEs from traditional GIS. Interactivity refers to the capability of users to actively engage with the virtual environment. It allows exploration, manipulation, and query of information. This can be in the form of changing viewpoints, selecting different layers, allowing for measurements, and immersion among others. Interactivity is also the basis for collaboration and participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of involving the public in GIS, ensuring their spatial knowledge is valued alongside that of experts and decision-makers has been highlighted. Additionally, traditional GIS tend to be highly field-related and and characterized by a lack of the necessary level of interactivity to allow for participation, increasing the entry barriers for experts from other fields and the public. Thus, the urgent need for user-friendly and interactive interfaces to facilitate convenient participation in information collection, experimentation, and decision-making processes. In response, VGEs offer a practical solution by providing a platform for idea exchange that goes beyond abstract representations (Lin et al., 2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important concepts to be explored here are Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). In GIScience Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) is a significant concept, which focuses on how people perceive, manipulate, and interact with representations of the real world. PGIS offers a distinctive approach to involve the public in decision-making processes. It aims to incorporate local knowledge, integrate and contextualize intricate spatial information, enable dynamic interaction and input from participants, facilitate the analysis of alternatives, and empower individuals and groups (Sieber, 2006) and the potential and need for PGIS to not only involve participation but also disruption, supporting progressive change for thehistorically marginalized has also been highlited (Radil and Anderson, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential uses of PGIS include: 1) aiding future professionals, communities, and government departments in understanding the growing complexity of land use planning, resource use, and community development; 2) utilizing the potential of digital data sources and techniques; 3) enhancing the proactive nature of community decision-making and improving community education on local environmental and social issues; and 4) aid researchers in making accurate predictions in their geographic models (Longley et al., 2005; Lü, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the diverse array of services provided by a VGE, it becomes evident that the requirements in terms of data, software proficiency, and hardware can be substantial. In the case of traditional GIS, significant time and effort are expended on software installation, updates, and maintenance, coupled with the steep learning curve associated with desktop applications. Furthermore, the hardware required to sustain such software is frequently inaccessible or unnecessary for many individuals to obtain (Songer, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "Software as a Service (SaaS) is a method of delivering software applications as a service over the internet. Accessing a web-based application merely requires a computer, an internet browser, a reasonably reliable internet connection, and, in some cases, a subscription. The need for and advantages of the use of this type of technology was raised by many authors (Songer, 2011; Lin et al., 2013; Guimarães et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of a VGE\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to delve into the structure of a VGE, it is imperative to first address its applications. This is because the structure of a VGE is intricately tied to its usage and since the formal process of system design, which will be discussed later, begins with the identification of use cases. The use of a VGE can be classified into three levels, each level progressively more sophisticated than the previous and building upon it. In the first level VGEs are used as “a tool for multidimensional analysis of spatial data”, in the second level as “a tool for simulation of complex real-world geographic processes” and in the third level as \"a workspace for multi-participant-based collaborative geographic experiments\", see figure (Lin et al., 2013; Lin, Chen, and Lu, 2013)\n",

    "    <figcaption style=\"font-style:italic;\">Levels of use and its relation to the components of a VGE source: (Lin et al., 2013)</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive VGE (third level in Fig. 2.1) comprises four key components: data, modeling, interactivity, and collaboration. The data component,\n",
    "essential for organizing geographic data, encompasses vital information required to construct the virtual world. This includes metadata, spatial data acquired through UAV photogrammetry, specialized applications for data processing, images, instructions, explanatory text, and more. The interactive component empowers users to manipulate the virtual environment by offering a range of functionalities and features. It primarily consists of the user interface, incorporating graphical elements and visualization techniques that facilitate user interaction. The modeling component leverages the information from the data component and employs methodologies, algorithms, and various tools to simulate dynamic phenomena. Lastly, the collaboration component enables interaction among users and shared exploration of the virtual environment. The data and modeling components operate in the background, hidden from the user, and are made accessible through the interactive and collaborative components (Lin et al., 2013). While the ultimate goal is to achieve a comprehensive VGE, the initial focus of this application lies in the first level of use. This level comprises the data and interactive components, which primarily emphasize data acquisition, processing, and subsequent visualization with interactive features. It is important to note that the limitations of 2D geovisualization become apparent at this stage as explained in the Three-dimensional reconstruction section. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow for creating a VGE\n",
    "\n",
    "A “curriculum flow” incorporating the design and building of VGEs is pro\u0002posed by Priestnall et al. (Priestnall et al., 2011). While originally develope for the context of higher education, the products obtained with this flow can be applied in different contexts and purposes like public outreach. The curriculum flow suggests that VGEs should be developed in four phases named Task & intended audience, Design issues, General technical approach, and Evaluation approach. Although the first and last phases are consistent with being the first and last activities in a timeline, the second and third phases can happen more in an iterative way since technical is and design issues are very much interdependent, and the level of dependency can change with the structure of the VGE. This workflow is the most general and comprehensive approach found to creating VGEs because it incorporates a wide range of technical and design considerations and emphasizes the importance of contemplating the user’s needs and learning goals at every stage of development. Here, these four phases will be renamed, reinterpreted and complemented with additional elements found in different more case specific workflows found in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope and objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into technical aspects of VGE development, it is essential to understand fundamental issues to avoid losing sight of the communication goal. The objectives of communication can be 1. Involving the user in an activity, often linked to tasks, games, or collaboration, 2. Enhancing spatial setting when exchanging and discovering geographic information. 3. Creat\u0002ing a feeling of visual authenticity, where the virtual models are more photorealistic and 4. Sensory immersion. The developer should carefully detail the size and type of audience detailing things like expected technical skills, available equipment and ethical considerations. The developer should also bear in mind the possibility of\n",
    "cognitive overload\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design (Interface & Interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "This component merges cartographic and graphic protocols and human- computer interaction (HCI) theories and should be considered regardless of the\n",
    "disciplinary home of the VGE. This stage builds directly on the preceding step, it takes into account the complex interactions between color and symbolism, light, and texture and considers carefully representations of abstract items within a landscape based on the possible interpretations of the audience. The design component is also dependent on the data component in the sense that it is directly affected by the type of data and data collection techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and other technical considerations (Collection, Integration & interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a wide range of possibilities in which this step might be approached according to disciplines and goals. Some components to consider in the data model can be ground or terrain models, ground texture, discrete objects models of physical dynamic phenomena, models of environmental conditions or other sensory elements, type of data and data collection, levels of interaction and collaboration. The sub-chapter “Features of Virtual Geographic Environments” in this document explains with greater detail some of the most important technical considerations in light of the specific application and scope of this work. A full description of the options for building every component of a VGE is beyond the scope of this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test and refine\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase happens once a satisfactory version of the VGE is developed. Here testing and validating its functionality, performance, and usability is the goal. This can be done by asking for feedback from potential users thus identifying and addressing any issues or limitations or by means of more sophisticated consideration of HCI evaluation protocols and can also imply revisiting of the previous stages at different levels as understanding grows, conditions change, or improved technology is available.\n",

It is based on an octree, which is a tree data structure where each node has eight children, representing a cube that is subdivided into eight smaller cubes. In an Octree LOD structure, the 3D scene is divided into a hierarchical structure of octants, each containing a subset of the scene's geometry.

    "The first level of the workflow is the base taken and adapted from (Priestnall et al., 2011) and explained in chapter 2. The second level refers to the application of this base into the specific field of study of this thesis. The initial step in the process is conceptualization, which involves comprehending the target group, scale, scope, data acquisition and processing techniques, required level of interactivity, and other relevant considerations. This step sets the foundation and structure for the subsequent workflow.\n",

    "To monitor river restoration, it was determined that the initial steps involve data collection and processing. The decision to set up a database depends on the volume of data and the stage of development of the VGE and its represented by the diamond shape in the workflow. Once the data is processed (the 3D virtual representation is created), hosting the VGE becomes necessary to enable interactivity. After that, to facilitate collaboration, a dedicated module should be created, allowing users to interact and exchange information synchronously or asynchronously. This module can incorporate features such as avatars and comment spaces, among others. Finally, the VGE should be tested and refined before making the first version available to the public.\n",

    "The third level of detail corresponds to a broac schematic representation of the workflow obtained as a result of the exploration process with the showcase and considering the specific scope of this thesis. In relation to the second level, the conceptualization corresponds to the theoretical framework described in chapter 2. The diamond shape in this case represents the need to determine the data collection possibilities (primary or secondary data). B1 and B2 correspond to the possibilities for data collection, B1 being UAV photogrammetry and B2 corresponds to complementing these images with publicly available data such as Open Source data like the one offered by the Open Topography project or OpenGeodata.NRW. C1 and C2 correspond to the identified tools for processing the data and C3 due to the limitations of this work is the VGE host in addition to being a processing tool. F1 and F2 correspond to identified tools to collaboratively further develop, test and refine the workflow and VGE (see section 4.3), these are not to be confused with the collaboration tools which are out of the scope of this work. The detailed workflow (third level) is the current document.\n",
