# About

This document shows a straightforward workflow to create an initial Virtual Geographic Environment from drone images and through using only Free and Open Source Software. This works focus is on the processing and visualization of the obtained photogrammetric data. However, some minimum requirements and steps before and during the drone mission will be described. Integrating the identified tools into a centralized user interface falls outside the scope.

This workflow was created as part of the thesis "Virtual Geographic Environments for Education and Public Outreach in River Development. Showcase: The Erft River Restoration Project in Neuss-Gnadental, Germany" 

# Getting Started

You can simply navegate the workflow by clicking in the `Outline.ipynb` file. You will be shown a preview of the file and multiple links to each step of the workflow.

### Install Jupyter 

To be able to explore this workflow on your computer 

* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Install Pip
* Install Jupyter notebook with pip

More information on the use of the Jupyter Project in this workflow is available [here](https://github.com/Isaramirezca/vge-workflow/blob/isa-branch/Exchange.ipynb)


# Credits

Hi there, my name is Isabel Ramírez, I am not a computer scientist or a programmer, but I created this tool to be understandable and affordable for non-developers. If you want to add features, instructions, or resources  you can make a branch of [this project](https://github.com/Isaramirezca/vge-workflow) on GitHub and use Jupiter Notebooks to add your contributions.
Otherwise, you can also write me an email at isabel.ramirez@correounivalle.edu.co, and I will add your contributions with credits. 

If you find mistakes, I would appreciate the heads up.  

* The code found in this showcase is based on the Potree project, its examples and showcases.
* Potree is a free, open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/) and research projects [Harvest4D](https://harvest4d.org/), [GCD Doctoral College](https://gcd.tuwien.ac.at/) and [Superhumans](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Superhumans/).
* This workflow was created as part of the thesis "Virtual Geographic Environments for Education and Public Outreach in River Development. Showcase: The Erft River Restoration Project in Neuss-Gnadental, Germany" for obtaining the Master's degree Master of Science in the study program Integrated Water Resources Management at the [Institute for Technology and Resources Management in the Tropics and Subtropics](https://www.tt.th-koeln.de/) at [TH Köln University of applied Sciences](https://www.th-koeln.de/), Cologne, Germany under the supervision of the Dr. rer. nat. [Georg Lamberty](https://www.th-koeln.de/personen/georg.lamberty/).
* The thesis is also part of the Valley of Mercy project, wich aims to developing a virtual teaching-learning space for the subject area "spatial development" using the example of the Erft restoration in Gnadental (Neuss)
* Part of the applied research project was financed by the [Planungsbüro Zumbroich](https://www.zumbroich.com/de/home)
