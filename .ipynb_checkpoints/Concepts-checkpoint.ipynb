    "## Octree LOD structure\n",
    "\n",
    "An Octree LOD (Level of Detail) structure is a data structure commonly used in computer graphics and 3D rendering to represent a 3D scene and manage its level of detail. It is based on an octree, which is a tree data structure where each node has eight children, representing a cube that is subdivided into eight smaller cubes. In an Octree LOD structure, the 3D scene is divided into a hierarchical structure of octants, each containing a subset of the scene's geometry. The octants are recursively subdivided until a desired level of detail is achieved. At higher levels of the octree, the geometry is represented with a lower level of detail, while at lower levels, more detailed geometry is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hierarchical structure allows for efficient management of the level of detail of the scene. The octree can be traversed to determine which parts of the scene are visible from a given viewpoint, and the appropriate level of detail can be selected and rendered for each part of the scene. Octree LOD structures are commonly used in real-time rendering applications, such as video games and virtual reality environments, where performance is critical, and the scene complexity can vary depending on the viewer's perspective. They are also used in other applications, such as scientific visualization and architecture."
