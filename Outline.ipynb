    "This document shows a straightforward workflow to create an initial Virtual Geographic Environment from drone images and through the use of only Free and Open Source Software. This works focus is on the processing and visualization of the obtained photogrammetric data. However, some minimum requirements and steps before and during the drone mission will be described. \n",

    "A big part of the workflow can be followed with MacOS. However, the visualization and interactivity with the point cloud can until now only be done with WindowsOS. Once Potree is available for MacOS the entire workflow will also be replicable with this Operative Sistem.  \n",

    "Hi there, my name is Isabel Ramírez, I am not a computer scientist and I created this tool to be understandable and affordable for non-developers. If you want to add, features, instructions or resources  you can make a branch of this project in [Github](https://github.com/Isaramirezca/vge-workflow) and use Jupiter Notebooks to add your findings. \n",
