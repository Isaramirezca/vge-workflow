    "This document shows a straightforward workflow to create an initial Virtual Geographic Environment from drone images and through the use of only Free and Open Source Software. This works focus is on the processing and visualization of the obtained photogrammetric data. However, some minimum requirements and steps before and during the drone mission will be described. \n",

    "Otherwise you can also write me an email to isabel.ramirez@correounivalle.edu.co and I will add your contributions with credits. \n",
