    "Potree is a JavaScript library for visualizing large point clouds in 3D in a web browser. It is a free, open-source WebGL-based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.uuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/). Potree is not yet in a development phase in which a user-friendly platform is available. Currently, the resources available are directed at software developers, and command line use is required. Therefore, a detailed (for non-developers) step by step guide is described below. In order to install and use Potree the use of the command line is necessary. Here some basics on the [command line](./Basics.ipynb).\n",

    "Before starting with potree. it is advisable to read Potree [thesis](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2016/SCHUETZ-2016-POT/SCHUETZ-2016-POT-thesis.pdf) document and [paper.](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2020/SCHUETZ-2020-MPC/SCHUETZ-2020-MPC-paper.pdf) \n",

    "Potree Converter generates an [octree LOD structure](./Concepts.ipynb) for streaming and real-time rendering of massive point clouds. In simple words, PotreeConverter takes the point cloud obtained with photogrammetry or Lidar technology and processed in for example ODM, optimize it and convert it into a format that can be easily rendered and explored in a web-based environment. The conversion process involves several steps, including data decimation, octree generation, level of detail (LOD) creation, and metadata generation. \n",
    "Download Potree converter from [GitHub](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter). Since our interest is not to modify source code of the application, the version to be downloaded can be found in the “about section - [releases](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/releases)” right side of the PotreeConverter GitHub website, see figure\n",
