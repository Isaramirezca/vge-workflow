    "## Potree\n",
    "\n",
    "Potree is a JavaScript library for visualizing large point clouds in 3D in a web browser. It is a free open-source WebGL based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It is based on the [TU Wien Scanopy project](https://www.cg.uuwien.ac.at/research/projects/Scanopy/). Potree is not yet in a development phase in which a user-friendly platform is available. Currently, the resources available are directed to software developers and command line use is required. Therefore, a detailed (for non-developers) step by step guide is described below. In order to install and use Potree the use of the command line is necesary, here some [basics](./Basics.ipynb).\n",

    "Generates an [octree LOD structure](./Concepts.ipynb) for streaming and real-time rendering of massive point clouds. In simple words, PotreeConverter takes the point cloud produced photogrammetry or Lidar technology in for example ODM and convert it into an interactive, web-based visualizations called Potree point clouds. The results can be viewed in web browsers with Potree or as a desktop application with PotreeDesktop.\n",
    "Download Potree converter from [GitHub](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter). Since our interest is not to modify source code of the application, the version to be downloaded can be found in the “about section - [releases](https://github.com/potree/PotreeConverter/releases)” right side of the PotreeConverter GitHub website, see figure\n",

Locate the command prompt application in windows and with the cd command locate the folder where potree converter is located, to make it easier, you can simply open the file explorer and look for the downloaded and extracted folder, right click in the folder and click the option “copy as a path” and in the command prompt paste this after the cd command separated by a space:  \n",
